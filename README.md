# DEEP LEARNING CHALLENGE

Implementation of Deep Learning Challenge which contains 4 versions of GANs
* A GAN with linear layers only
* A GAN with linear layers and batch normalization
* A GAN with 2D CNN layers and 2D Batch Normalization
* A GAN with 2D CNN layers and Spectral Normalization

## Running Code

To run all versions of GANs, open each notebook and run all cells



## Results
